# Percona Toolkit: pt-kill

`pt-kill` is a powerful command-line tool from Percona Toolkit designed to automatically kill MySQL queries that meet specific conditions. It's especially useful for terminating long-running or resource-intensive queries to help maintain database performance. You can set time limits, query patterns, and even configure custom rules for when queries should be killed.

## Installation

Ensure that Percona Toolkit is installed before using `pt-kill`. Use the following methods to install it:

### On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get install percona-toolkit
```

### On CentOS/RHEL
```bash
sudo yum install percona-toolkit
```

### Using Homebrew (macOS)
```bash
brew install percona-toolkit
```

For more installation details, see the official [Percona Toolkit Installation Guide](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/).

## Usage

```bash
pt-kill [OPTIONS]
```

### Required Options
- `--host`: The MySQL server hostname or IP address.
- `--user`: The MySQL user.
- `--password`: The MySQL user password.

### Common Options
- `--interval`: Specifies the interval (in seconds) between checking queries (default is 1 second).
- `--long-query-time`: Defines the threshold (in seconds) for queries to be considered long-running and eligible for termination.
- `--kill`: Automatically kill the long-running queries that match the conditions.
- `--where`: Allows you to filter queries based on specific conditions, such as query content or execution time.

## Example Usage

### 1. Kill Queries Running Longer than 60 Seconds
This command will monitor queries running for more than 60 seconds and automatically kill them.

```bash
pt-kill --host=localhost --user=root --password=yourpassword --long-query-time=60 --kill
```

### 2. Kill Specific Queries Matching a Pattern
If you want to terminate all queries that involve `UPDATE` operations and run longer than 5 seconds, you can specify a pattern and a time limit like this:

```bash
pt-kill --host=localhost --user=root --password=yourpassword --long-query-time=5 --where 'command="Query" AND info LIKE "UPDATE%"' --kill
```

### 3. Monitor and Kill Queries with a Custom Interval
You can also adjust the interval at which the tool checks for long-running queries. For instance, to kill any query running for over 120 seconds, with a check every 5 seconds:

```bash
pt-kill --host=localhost --user=root --password=yourpassword --long-query-time=120 --interval=5 --kill
```

### 4. Dry Run (Preview Queries That Would Be Killed)
You can preview which queries would be killed without actually terminating them by omitting the `--kill` flag:

```bash
pt-kill --host=localhost --user=root --password=yourpassword --long-query-time=30
```

This command will list all queries longer than 30 seconds that would be terminated, without actually killing them.

## Output

If the `--kill` option is used, `pt-kill` will output a confirmation message for each query it kills. If you choose the dry-run method, it will simply show you the queries that meet your specified conditions.

Example output:

```
Query id 12345 (Thread id 100) was running for 70 seconds, killing it now.
Query id 12346 (Thread id 101) was running for 180 seconds, killing it now.
```

## Conclusion

`pt-kill` is an effective tool for automating the termination of long-running or problematic queries in MySQL databases. It helps keep your system performance in check by eliminating queries that could negatively impact your serverâ€™s resources. The tool provides various customization options, such as filtering queries by patterns or controlling the kill interval.
