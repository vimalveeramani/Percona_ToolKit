The **`pt-index-usage`** tool from Percona Toolkit helps you analyze and monitor index usage in MySQL databases. It shows you which indexes are being used and which ones are not, which can help identify redundant or unused indexes. This tool is useful for optimizing MySQL performance by cleaning up unnecessary indexes and improving query performance.

---

### **`pt-index-usage` Tool Overview**

The `pt-index-usage` tool analyzes your MySQL server's query logs to determine which indexes are being used by your queries. It can identify indexes that are not used at all, helping you clean up redundant indexes that may slow down your queries and consume unnecessary resources.

1. Add Percona repository:
   ```bash
   wget https://repo.percona.com/apt/percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
   sudo dpkg -i percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. Install Percona Toolkit:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install percona-toolkit
   ```

#### **Install on macOS**

1. Install Homebrew (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Install Percona Toolkit:
   ```bash
   brew install percona-toolkit
   ```

### **Using `pt-index-usage`**

#### **Basic Syntax**
```bash
pt-index-usage [OPTIONS] -- <MYSQL-OPTIONS>
```

Where `MYSQL-OPTIONS` refers to the MySQL command-line options, such as `--host`, `--user`, `--password`, etc.

---

### **Key Options**

- **`--no-progress`**: Disable progress bar output.
- **`--log`**: Specify the path to the MySQL general query log file. This is necessary to analyze which indexes are used in queries.
- **`--show-all`**: Show all indexes, including unused ones.
- **`--database`**: Specify the database to analyze.
- **`--tables`**: Limit the analysis to specific tables.
- **`--verbose`**: Display more information, such as the number of rows scanned and other debug details.
- **`--max-length`**: Set the maximum length of query output for readability.
- **`--ignored`**: Ignore certain types of queries (e.g., `SHOW`, `SELECT COUNT(*)`, etc.) that aren't typically useful for index analysis.

---

### **Example 1: Analyzing Index Usage**

To analyze index usage for a specific MySQL database and generate a report:

```bash
pt-index-usage --host=localhost --user=root --password --database=mydatabase --log=/path/to/mysql_query_log
```

This command will:
- Connect to the MySQL server using the specified host, user, and password.
- Analyze the query log located at `/path/to/mysql_query_log` for the `mydatabase` database.
- Show which indexes are used by the queries in that log.

---

### **Example 2: Analyzing Multiple Tables**

If you want to analyze index usage for specific tables within a database, you can use the `--tables` option:

```bash
pt-index-usage --host=localhost --user=root --password --database=mydatabase --tables=table1,table2 --log=/path/to/mysql_query_log
```

This command will only analyze the `table1` and `table2` in the `mydatabase` database.

---

### **Example 3: Show Unused Indexes**

If you want to show all indexes (including unused ones), use the `--show-all` option:

```bash
pt-index-usage --host=localhost --user=root --password --database=mydatabase --log=/path/to/mysql_query_log --show-all
```

This command will show all the indexes in the `mydatabase` database, including those that are not used in any queries.

---

### **Example 4: Ignore Certain Query Types**

Sometimes, you might want to exclude certain query types from the analysis (e.g., `SELECT COUNT(*)` or `SHOW` commands). You can do this by using the `--ignored` option:

```bash
pt-index-usage --host=localhost --user=root --password --database=mydatabase --log=/path/to/mysql_query_log --ignored="SELECT COUNT(*)"
```

This will ignore all `SELECT COUNT(*)` queries while analyzing index usage.

---

### **Output Example**

The tool generates a report indicating which indexes are used and which are not. A typical output would look like:

```text
Table    Index            Query Count   Rows Scanned   Index Usage
---------------------------------------------------------------
users    PRIMARY          1000          5000           100%
users    idx_name         0             0              0%
orders   PRIMARY          1500          7000           100%
orders   idx_date         200           1000           10%
```

- **`Table`**: The name of the table.
- **`Index`**: The name of the index.
- **`Query Count`**: The number of times the index was used in queries.
- **`Rows Scanned`**: The number of rows scanned for queries using the index.
- **`Index Usage`**: The percentage of time the index was used in queries.

---

### **Advanced Options**

- **`--check-unique`**: Checks whether there are multiple unique indexes on the same column. This can help identify redundant unique constraints.
- **`--threshold`**: Set a threshold for minimum query count before reporting an index as unused. For example, an index that was used fewer than 5 times could be marked as unused.
- **`--no-skip`**: By default, the tool skips certain types of queries. This option forces the tool to analyze all queries, even those with minimal impact.

---

### **Known Issues**

- **Inaccurate Log Data**: If the query log is incomplete or doesn't reflect actual usage, the tool's analysis may not be entirely accurate.
- **Permissions**: The user running `pt-index-usage` needs permission to access the MySQL general query log, as well as permission to read the tables being analyzed.
- **Log Rotation**: If the query log is rotated frequently, ensure that the log file you are analyzing contains a representative sample of queries.

---

### **Use Cases for `pt-index-usage`**

- **Identify Unused Indexes**: Find indexes that are never used by any queries, so they can be safely removed to improve performance.
- **Optimize Indexing**: Improve query performance by identifying overused indexes and reducing redundant indexes.
- **Database Cleanup**: Clean up indexes that are no longer needed, reducing the size of the database and speeding up queries.
